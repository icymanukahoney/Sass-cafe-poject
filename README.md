## O.G.B Bar App - SASS Project

**The O.G.B is one of the favourite bars for local people and tourists in Christchurch.**

**The goal of the project: create an app (mobile and tablet) for customers that would be useful and functional to help them look at the menu, make an order and look at the special offers.**

**This is only student SASS project. **

### For our project, we utilize various tools such as VS Code,  Figma, and Chrome Dev.

*VS Code (Visual Studio Code) provides extensible platform for writing and editing code.*

*Figma provides a wide range of design and prototyping features, enabling designers to create their designs seamlessly. Figma allowed us to create mockups for our project.*

*Chrome DevTools allows us to inspect and debug web app, modify styles in real-time, and troubleshoot our web application.*

### Developed by Maria Stromova. 
:pouting_woman: **I am a student at Yoobee College, specializing in UX Design and Web Development.**

**In the realm of user experience (UX) design, I have learned the art of crafting interfaces that prioritize the needs and preferences of users. The digital products I create are not only visually appealing but also highly functional and enjoyable to use.**

**Web development is the backbone of my journey as a developer. I have delved into the world of programming languages such as HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, and beyond. Additionally, I have explored frameworks and libraries like React, and Bootstrap to deliver more robust and efficient web solutions.**
