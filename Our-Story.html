<h3><b>our story.</b></h3>

<p><b>A carpenter, a fisherman and a rugby player.</b></p>
<p><strong>Nick, Andrew and Richard, the trio behind the heritage. </strong></p>
<p><strong>With vastly different backgrounds the common </strong></p>
<p><strong>passion being Christchurch, the people & good old </strong></p>
<p><strong>fashioned hospitality.</strong></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Nick Inkster, founding Proprietor, dreamt up plans to open a</p>
<p>small bar during his time working as a carpenter in Western </p>
<p>Australia (an idea also sown by his dad Robin Inkster, who</p>
<p>always thought Nick would open a bar some day). </p>
<p>After the Christchurch earthquakes in 2011, this Canterbury </p>
<p>born lad knew it was time to come home and give back to the city </p>
<p>that he loved so much. Nick always had a strong affiliation with </p>
<p>Cathedral Square, as a young boy living in the eastern suburbs </p>
<p>he remembers visiting the Square often with his family, </p>
<p>knowing there was something special about it.</p>
<p>Through this the O.G.B Bar was born, sitting proudly </p>
<p>on the corner of Cathedral Square and Worcester Street.</p>
<br>
<p>Little did he know then, O.G.B was only the beginning. Down</p>
<p>the hall followed Frederick Woodwards Barber Shop and </p>
<p>Parlour  Cocktail Bar. In order to continue pouring the heritage back </p>
<p>into Christchurch, Nick partnered with his good friends,  Andrew</p>
<p>and Richard Norton. The Norton brothers brought with them their</p>
<p>renowned suburban pubs and wealth of knowledge. The trio </p>
<p>then started Austin Club, a late night basement bar, paying homage to</p>
<p>the post-war period. Quickly after, Paddy McNaughton’s Irish Pub </p>
<p>was born and iconic Lyttelton hot spot Civil & Naval joined.</p>
<br>
<p>The trio’s love for the people of Canterbury and the history behind</p>
<p>the beautiful city is what motivates them to create places rich in </p>
<p>heritage and warmth. The journey has only just begun, and we look</p>
<p>forward to the chapters ahead.</p>
